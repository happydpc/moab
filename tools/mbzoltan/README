A simple C++ example in the "mbzoltan" directory.  

The example is built with the Makefile found in
this directory, with the command:

gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH={arch} all

"arch" is the same name you used to specify your build
configuration when you built the Zoltan library.

The Zoltan library must be compiled with PARMETIS to use any of the PARMETIS
methods.

The Zoltan directory must be parallel to the MOAB directory.

Also, the static MOAB and HDF5 libraries must be in /usr/local/.

Note that C++ implementations vary widely.  If you have trouble
building the example, try defining or not defining
the MPI_CPP or NAMESPACES_OK values in the source file.

To run the example, launch it on any number of processes as you would 
any MPI application:

mpirun -np 4 mbzoltan <mesh_file> <write_out(y/n)> <output_mesh_file> <method(RCB/RIB/HSFC/PARMETIS)> [<parmetis_method>]
