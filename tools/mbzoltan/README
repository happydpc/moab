A static and dynamic mesh partitioning tool based on the Zoltan
library.  Partition information is saved to entity sets and elements
using the PARALLEL_PARTITION tag, whose value indicates the rank of
the owning process.

Usage: 

mpiexec -np <nprocs> mbzoltan <# partitions> <mesh_file> <write_out(y/n)> <output_mesh_file>
   [<method(RCB/RIB/HSFC/Hypergraph(PHG)/PARMETIS/OCTPART)>]
   [<parmetis_method>/<oct_method>]

This code can be run on a single processor to do static partitioning,
though it still must be run under control of mpi using mpiexec.
