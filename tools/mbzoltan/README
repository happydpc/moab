A simple C++ example in the "mbzoltan" directory.  

The example is built with the Makefile found in
this directory, with the command:

gmake

The Zoltan library must be compiled with PARMETIS to use any of the PARMETIS
methods.

The Zoltan directory must be given relative to the MOAB directory when MOAB is
configured.

The Zoltan "arch" is the same name you used to specify your build
configuration when you built the Zoltan library and also must be given when
MOAB is configured.

Note that C++ implementations vary widely.  If you have trouble
building the example, try defining or not defining
the MPI_CPP or NAMESPACES_OK values in the source file.

To run the example, launch it on any number of processes as you would 
any MPI application:

mpirun -np 4 mbzoltan <mesh_file> <write_out(y/n)> <output_mesh_file> <method(RCB/RIB/HSFC/PARMETIS/OCTPART)> [<parmetis_method/oct_method>]
