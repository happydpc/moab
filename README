MOAB: Mesh-Oriented datA Base
Read Me

API version: 1.00
Implementation version: 1.00
=====================================

MOAB is a component for representing and evaluating mesh data.  MOAB
can store structured and unstructured mesh, consisting of elements in
the finite element "zoo".  The functional interface to MOAB is simple
yet powerful, allowing the representation of many types of metadata
commonly found on the mesh.  MOAB is optimized for efficiency in space
and time, based on access to mesh in chunks rather than through
individual entities, while also versatile enough to support individual
entity access.

MOAB can be used in several ways: as the underlying mesh data
representation for applications (MOAB is used in this way in the VERDE
mesh verification code, as a mesh input mechanism (using mesh readers
included with MOAB), or as a translator between mesh formats (using
readers and writers included with MOAB).

MOAB was developed as part of the CUBIT project at Sandia National
Laboratories, and was partially funded by the DOE SciDAC program as
part of the Terascale Tools and Technologies (TSTT) center.

=====================================
Dependencies
=====================================

MOAB depends on the NetCDF libraries (C and C++) to compile the
ExodusII reader/writer.  Support for C++ was added to netcdf in version 3.5.1, and 
took a bit of time to get compiling ironed out, so make sure you have version 3.6 or
later.  To get netcdf, search the web or try 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/.

The only way to save all the data in MOAB is to write it to a
MOAB-specific HDF5 file.  Support for HDF5 is turned off by default in
the distributed version of MOAB.  To turn it on, add the line:

HDF5_FILE = yes

to your MB.local file.  This will add a dependency on HDF5.  To tell
make where to find HDF5 include and library files, change the
definition of HDF5_DIR in MB.common to suit your system.

=====================================
Compiling
=====================================

1. Unpack the source code in some directory MOAB_DIR.
2. Touch or create a file named MOAB_DIR/MB.local.
3. Define an environment variable with your machine type named
MACHINE_TYPE; options for MOAB are:
   lin: Linux
   ss: Sun Solaris
   sg: SGI
   da: DEC Alpha
   hp: HP (HP/UX 11)

4. Edit the information in MOAB_DIR/MB.$(MACHINE_TYPE), changing
definitions so that things can be found.  Alternatively, you can put
the modified definitions into MB.local; doing so will mean you won't
lose those definitions if you unpack an updated version of MOAB (or, if
you're committing something to CVS repository, you won't change the
distributed version of the MB.xx files).
5. If you want HDF5 support, follow directions above under 'Dependencies'
6. For first-time compiles, touch the file make.dependencies 
('touch make.dependencies').
7. Make dependencies ('make depend') (this might generate warnings
about missing system includes, which you can usually ignore).
8. Make the MOAB shared library (libMOAB.so) by typing 'make'.  If
desired, make the static library (libMOAB.a) by typing 'make static'.
Making the libraries also makes the test programs packaged with MOAB.
9. Make sure the MOAB shared library location is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable (see the man page for your shell for instructions on
how to set environment variables).
10. Test the code: './moab_test; ./moab_test.static'.  NOTE: one of the tests
in moab_test requires a vary large file, which is stored in gzipped form in
the repository.  In order for this test to pass, you must gunzip this file 
by entering the following command:
gunzip mb_bit_test.g.gz
